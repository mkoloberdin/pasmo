<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a>.</h2>

<p>
Pasmo is a multiplatform Z80 cross-assembler, easy to compile and easy to
use. It can generate object code in several formats suitable for many
Z80 machines and emulators.<br>
Pasmo generates fixed position code, can not be used to create relocatable
object files for use with linkers.
</p>

<p>
Pasmo is compatible with the syntax used in several old assemblers, by
supporting several styles of numeric and string literals and by
providing several names of the most used directives.<br>
However, in Pasmo the Z80 mnemonics, register and flags names and
directives are reserved words, this may require changes of symbol
names conflicting in some programs.
</p>

<h2><a name="install">Installation</a>.</h2>

<p>
Download Pasmo from
<a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/"
>http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/</a>.
A binary executable for windows is provided, for other platforms you must
download the source package and compile it. If you want to compile it in
windows you can use cygwin or mingw with the Makefile provided, with other
compilers you may need to create a project, workspace or whatever your
compiler or IDE uses.<br>
To compile you need gcc version 2.95 or later, with the c++ language
included (usually a package called g++-something).<br>
Others compilers may also be used, any reasonable standard complaint
c++ compiler must compile it with few or none corrections.<br>
Just execute 'make' in the pasmo directory, and the excutable will be
generated. There is no install, you must manually copy the executable
to a directory in the PATH, if you want.
</p>

<h2><a name="command">Command line use</a>.</h2>

<p>
Pasmo is invoked from command line as:
</p>

<pre>
	pasmo [options] file.asm file.bin [file.symbol]
</pre>

<p>
Where file.asm is the source file, file.bin is the object file to be created
and optionally file.symbol is the file where the symbol table will be
written, use - to write it in the standard output. Options can be zero or
more of the following:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>-d</dt>
<dd>Show debug info during second pass of assembly.</dd>

<dt>-1 (digit 'one')</dt>
<dd>Show debug info during both passes of assembly.</dd>

<dt>-v</dt>
<dd>
Verbose mode. Show progress information about loading of files,
progress of assembly and maybe other things.
</dd>

<dt>-I (upper case i)</dt>
<dd>Add directory to the list for searching files in INCLUDE and
INCBIN.</dd>

<dt>-E</dt>
<dd>Same as --equ</dd>

<dt>--hex</dt>
<dd>Generate the object file in Intel HEX format.</dd>

<dt>--prl</dt>
<dd>Generate the object file in PRL format, useful for CP/M Plus RSX.</dd>

<dt>--plus3dos</dt>
<dd>Generate the object file with PLUS3DOS header (Spectrum disk).</dd>

<dt>--tap</dt>
<dd>Generate a .tap file for Spectrum emulators (tape image).</dd>

<dt>--tapbas</dt>
<dd>Same as --tap but adding a Basic loader before the code.</dd>

<dt>--amsdos</dt>
<dd>Generate the object file with Amsdos header (Amstrad CPC disk).</dd>

<dt>--msx</dt>
<dd>Generate the object file with header for use with BLOAD in MSX Basic.</dd>

<dt>--public</dt>
<dd>The symbol table listing will include only symbols declared as PUBLIC.</dd>

<dt>--name</dt>
<dd>Name to put in the header in the formats that use it. If unspecified
the object file name will be used.</dd>

<dt>--err</dt>
<dd>Direct error messages to standard output instead of error output
(except for errors in options).</dd>

<dt>--nocase</dt>
<dd>Make identifiers case insensitive.</dd>

<dt>--alocal</dt>
<dd>Use autolocal mode. In this mode all labels that begins with '_'
are locals. See the chapter about labels for details.
.</dd>

<dt>--equ</dt>
<dd>
Predefine a symbol. Predefined symbol are treated in a similar way as
defineds with EQU. Some possible uses are exemplified in the black.asm
example file. The syntax is: '--equ label=value' where label must be
a valid label name and value a numeric constant in a format valid in
pasmo syntax. The part =value is optional, if not specified the value
asigned is FFFF hex.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
When no option for code generation is specified, the format used is
binary without headers.
</p>

<p>
The -d option is intended to debug pasmo itself, but can also be useful
to find errors in asm code. When used the information is showed in the
standard output. Error messages goes to error ouptut unless the --err
option is used.
</p>

<h2><a name="codegen">Code generation information</a>.</h2>

<h3><a name="codegendefault">Default mode</a></h3>

<p>
The default mode just dumps the code generated from the first
position used without any header. This mode can be used for
direct generation of CP/M or MSX COM files, supposed that you
use a ORG 100H directive at the beginning of the code, or to
generate blocks of code to be INCBINed in other programs.
</p>

<h3><a name="codegenhex">--hex mode</a></h3>

<p>
The --hex mode generates code in Intel HEX format. This format can
be used with the LOAD or HEXCOM CP/M utilities, can be transmitted
more easily than a binary format, and is also used in some PROM
programming tools.
</p>

<h3><a name="codegenprl">--prl mode</a></h3>

<p>
The prl format is used in several variants of Digital Research CP/M
operating system. In pasmo is supported only to create RSX files for
use in CP/M Plus, use for PRL files in MP/M is not supported because
I don't have a MP/M system, real or emulated, where to test it.
</p>

<h3><a name="codegentap">--tap mode</a></h3>

<p>
The --tap options generates a tap file with a code block, with the
loading position set to the beginnig of the code so you can load it
with a LOAD "" CODE instruction.
</p>

<h3><a name="codegentapbas">--tapbas mode</a></h3>

<p>
With the --tapbas option a tap file is generated with two parts:
a Basic loader and a code block with the object code. The Basic
loader does a CLEAR before the initial address of the code, loads
the code, and executes it if a entry point is defined (see the END
directive). That way you can directly launch the code in a emulator,
or transfer it to a tape for use in a real Spectrum.
</p>

<h3><a name="codegensymbol">Symbol table</a></h3>

<p>
The symbol table generated contains all identifiers used in the program,
with the locals represented as a 8 digit hexadecimal number in order of
use, unless the --public option is used. In that case only the symbols
specified in PUBLIC directives are listed.
</p>

<p>
The symbol table format is a list of EQU directives. That way you can
INCLUDE it in another source to create programs composed of several
blocks.
</p>

<h2><a name="source">Source code format</a>.</h2>

<h3><a name="sourcegeneral">Generalities</a>.</h3>

<p>
Source code files must be valid text files in the platform used. The use of,
for example, unix text files under pasmo in windows, is unsupported and the
result is undefined (may depend of the compiler used to build pasmo, for
example). The result of the use of a file that contains vertical tab or
form feed characters is also undefined.
</p>

<p>
Everything after a ; in a line is a comment (unlees the ; is part of a
string literal, of course). There are no nultiline comments, you can
use IF 0 .... ENDIF instead (but see INCLUDE).
</p>

<p>
String literals are written to the object file without any character set
translation. Then the use of any character with a different meaning in
the platform were pasmo is running and the destination machine must be
avoided, and the code of the character may be used instead. That also
means that using Pasmo in any machine that uses a non ascii compatible
character set may be difficult, and that a source written in utf-8 may
give undesired results. This may be changed in future versions of Pasmo.
</p>

<p>
A line may begin with a decimal number followed by blanks. This number
is ignored by the assembler, is allowed for compatibility with old
assemblers. The line number reported in errors is the sequential number
of the line in the file, not this.
</p>

<p>
Blanks are significative only in string literals and when they separate
lexical elements. Any number of blanks has the same meaning as one.
A blank between operators and operands is allowed but no required except
when the same character has other meaning as prefix ('$' and '%', for
example).
</p>

<h3><a name="sourcelit">Literals</a>.</h3>

<h4><a name="sourcelitnum">Numeric literals</a>.</h4>

<p>
Numeric literals can be written in decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal
formats. Several formats are accepted to obtain compatibility with the
source format of several assemblers.
</p>

<p>
A literal that begins with $ is a hexadecimal constant, except if the
literal is only the $ symbol, in that case is an operator, see below.
</p>

<p>
A literal that begins with # is a hexadecimal constant.
</p>

<p>
A literal that begins with &amp; can be hexadecimal, octal or binary
constant, depending of the character that follows the &amp;: H means
hexadecimal, O octal and X hexadecimal, if none of this the caracter
must be a valid hexadecimal digit and the constant is hexadecimal.
</p>

<p>
A literal that begins with % is a binary constant, except if the literal
is only the % symbol, in that case is an operator, see below.
</p>

<p>
A literal that begins with a decimal digit can be a decimal, binary,
octal or hexadecimal. If the digit is 0 and the following character is
an X, the number is hexadecimal. If not, the suffix of the literal is
examined: D means decimal, B binary, H hexadcimal and O or Q octal,
in any other case is taken as decimal. Take care, FFFFh for example is
not an hexadecimal constant, is an identifier, to write it with the
suffix notation you must do it as 0FFFFh.
</p>

<h4><a name="sourcelitstr">String literals</a>.</h4>

<p>
There are two formats of string literals: single or double quote
delimited.
</p>

<p>
A string literal delimited with single quotes is the simpler format,
all characters are included in the string without any special
interpretation, with the only exception that two consecutive single
quotes are taken as one single quote character to be included in the
string. For example: the single quote delimited string
'That''s all folks' generates the same string as the double quote
delimited &quot;That's all folks&quot;.
</p>

<p>
A string literal delimited with double quotes is interpreted in a
way similar to the C and C++ languages. The \ character is taken
as escape character, with the following interpretations: n is a
new line character (0A hex), r is a carriage return (0D hex), t is
a tabulator (09 hex), a is a bell (07 hex), x indicates that the
two next characters will be considered the hexadecimal code of
a char and a char with that code is inserted, an octal digit prefixes
and begins an octal number of up to three digits, and the corresponding
character is inserted into the string, the characters \ and &quot;
means to insert itself in the string, and any other char is reserved
for future use.
</p>

<p>
A string literal of length 1 can be used as a numeric constant with
the numeric value of the character contained. This allows expressions
such as 'A' + 80h to be evaluated as expected.
</p>

<h3><a name="sourceident">Identifiers</a>.</h3>

<p>
Identifiers are the names used for labels, EQU and DEFL symbols and
macro names and parameters. The names of the Z80 mnemonics, registers
and flag names, and of pasmo operands and assemble directives are
reserved and can not be used as names of identifiers. Reserved names
are case insensitive, even if case sensitive mode is used.
</p>

<p>
In the following 'letter' means an english letter character in
upper or lower case. Characters that correspond to letters in
other languages are not allowed in identifiers.
</p>

<p>
Identifiers begins with a letter, '_', '?', '@' or '.', followed for
zero or more letter, decimal digit, '_', '?', '@', '.' or '$'.
The '$' are ignored. Identifiers that begins with '_' are special
when using autolocal mode, see the --alocal option and the chapter
about labels.
</p>

<p>
Identifiers are case sensitive if the option --nocase is not used.
When using --nocase, they are always converted to upper case.
</p>

<h3><a name="sourcefilename">File names</a>.</h3>

<p>
File names are used in the INCLUDE and INCBIN directives. They follow
special rules.
</p>

<p>
A file name that begins with a double quote character must end with
another double quote, and the file name contains all character between
them without any special interpretation.
</p>

<p>
A file name that begins with a single quote character must end with
another single quote, and the file name contains all character between
them without any special interpretation.
</p>

<p>
In any other case all characteres until the next blank or the end of line
are considered part of the file name. Blank characters are space and tab.
</p>

<h3><a name="sourcelabel">Labels</a>.</h3>

<p>
A label can be placed at the beginning of any line, before any
assembler mnemonic or directive. Optionally can be followed by
a ':', but is not recommended to use it in directives, for
compatibility with other assemblers. A line that has a label
with no mnemonic nor directive is also valid.
</p>

<p>
The label has special meaning in the MACRO, EQU and DEFL directives,
in any other case the value of the current code generation position is
assigned to the label.
</p>

<p>
Labels can be used before his definition, but the result of doing this
with labels assigned with DEFL is undefined.
</p>

<p>
The value of a label cannot be changed unless DEFL is used in all
assignments of that label. If the value assigned to a label is
different in the two passes of the assembly the program is illegal,
but is not guaranteed that an error is generated. However, is legal
to assign a value undefined in the first pass (by using an expression
that contains a label not yet defined, for example).
</p>

<p>
In the default mode a label is global unless declared as LOCAL into
a MACRO, REP or IRP block, see the LOCAL directive for details.
</p>

<p>
In the autolocal mode, introduced by using the --alocal command line
option, all labels that begins with a '_' are locals. His ambit ends
at the next non local label or in the next PROC, LOCAL, MACRO, ENDP
or ENDM directive.
</p>

<p>
Both automatic and explicit local labels are represented in the symbol
table listing as 8 digit hexadecimal numbers, corresponding to the first
use of the label in the source.
</p>

<h2><a name="directives">Directives</a>.</h2>

<p>
List of directives supported in Pasmo, in alphabetical order.
<p>

<dl>

<dd>DB</dd>
<dt>
Define Byte. The argument is a comma separated list of string literals
or numeric expressions. The string literals are inserted in the object
code, and the result of the numeric expression is inserted as a single
byte, truncating it if needed.
</dt>

<dd>DEFB</dd>
<dt>DEFine Byte, same as DB.</dt>

<dd>DEFL</dd>
<dt>DEFine Label. Must be preced by a label. The argument must be a
numeric expression, the result is assigned to the label. The label
used can be redefined with other DEFL directive.
</dt>

<dd>DEFM</dd>
<dt>DEFine Message, same as DB.</dt>

<dd>DEFS</dd>
<dt>DEFine Space, same as DS.</dt>

<dd>DEFW</dd>
<dt>Same as DW.</dt>

<dd>DS</dd>
<dt>Define Space. Take one or two comma separated arguments.
The first or only argument is the amount of space to define,
in bytes. The second is the value used to fill the space,
if absent 0 will be used.
</dt>

<dd>DW</dd>
<dt>Define Word. The argument is a comma separated list of numeric
expressions. Each numeric expression is evaluated as a two byte word
and the result inserted in the code in the Z80 word format.
</dt>

<dd>ELSE</dd>
<dt>See IF.
</dt>

<dd>END</dd>
<dt>Ends the assembly. If it has an argument is evaluated as a numeric
expression and the result is set as the program entry point. The result
of setting an entry point depends of the type of code generation used,
may be none but even in this case may be used for documentation
purposes.
</dt>

<dd>ENDIF</dd>
<dt>See IF.
</dt>

<dd>ENDM</dd>
<dt>Ends a macro, see the chapter about macros.
</dt>

<dd>ENDP</dd>
<dt>Marks the end of a PROC block, see PROC.
</dt>

<dd>EQU</dd>
<dt>EQUate. Must be preceded by a label. The argument must be a numeric
expression, the result is assigned to the label. The label used can't be
redefined.
</dt>

<dd>EXITM</dd>
<dt>Exits a macro, see the chapter about macros.
</dt>

<dd>IF</dd>
<dt>Contional assembly. The argument must be a numeric expression, a result
of 0 is considered as false, any other as true. If the argument is true the
following code is assembled until the end of the IF section or an ELSE
directive is encountered, else is ignored. If the ELSE direcive is present
the following code is ignored if the argument was true, or is assmbled if
was false.<br>
The IF section is ended with a ENDIF or a ENDM directive (in the last case
the ENDM has also his usual effect).<br>
IF can be nested, in that case each ELSE and ENDIF takes effect only on his
corresponding IF, but ENDM ends all pending IF sections.
</dt>

<dd>INCLUDE</dd>
<dt>Include a file. See the Source code format chapter for the conventions
used in the argument. The file is readed and the result is the same as if
the file were copied in the current file instead of the INCLUDE line.<br>
The file included may contain INCLUDE directives, and so on.<br>
INCLUDE directives are processed before the assembly phases, so the use
of IF directives to conditionally include different files is not allowed.
</dt>

<dd>INCBIN</dd>
<dt>INClude BINary. Include a binary file. Reads a binary file and insert
his content in the generated code at the current position. See the Source
code format chapter for the conventions used in the argument.
</dt>

<dd>IRP</dd>
<dt>Repeat a block of code substituing arguments. See the chapter about
macros.
</dt>

<dd>LOCAL</dd>
<dt>Marks identifiers as local to the current block. The block may be
a MACRO, REPT, IRP or PROC directive, the local ambit ends in the
corresponding ENDM or ENDP directive. The ambit begins at the LOCAL
directive, not at the beginning of the block, take care with that.<br>
If several LOCAL declations of the same identifier are used in the same
block, only the first has effect, the others are ignored.
</dt>

<dd>MACRO</dd>
<dt>Defines a macro, see the chapter about macros.
</dt>

<dd>ORG</dd>
<dt>ORiGin. Establishes the origin position where to place generated
code. Several ORG directives can be used in the same program, but if
the result is that code generated overwrites previous, the result is
undefined.
</dt>

<dd>PROC</dd>
<dt>Marks the begin of a PROC block. The only effect is to define
an ambit for LOCAL directives. The block ends with a corresponding
ENDP directive. The recommended use is to enclose a subroutine in
a PROC block, but can also be used in any other situation.
</dt>

<dd>PUBLIC</dd>
<dt>The argument is a comma separated list of identifiers. Each identifier
is marked as public. When using the --public command line option only the
identifiers marked as public are included in the symbol table listing.
</dt>

<dd>REPT</dd>
<dt>REPeaTs a block. See the chapter about macros.
</dt>

</dl>

	+, - (binary)
	EQ, NE, LT, LE, GT, GE,
	NOT, +, - (unary)
	AND
	OR, XOR
</pre>

<p>
All numeric values are taken as 16 bits unsigned, using 2 complement or
trucating when required. Logical operators return FFFF hex for true and 0
for false, in the arguments 0 is false and any other value true.
</p>

<p>
Alphabetic list of operators:

<h2><a name="macros">Macros</a>.</h2>

<h2><a name="discussion">About suggestions and possible improvements</a>.</h2>

<p>
The assumption of Pasmo if that, being a cross-assembler, it will be
used on a machine with many available resources. Then I do not make
any effort to provide means to do things that can be easily made
with other utilities, unless I think (or other people convince me)
that including it in Pasmo can be much more convenient.<br>
For example, if you want to create a sin table you can write a program
in your favourite language that writes a file with the table and
INCLUDE that file, if you want a .tzx file instead of a .tap there
are conversion utilities availables, and if you want to automate that
type of things you can use make.
</p>

<p>
Taken that into account, I am open to suggestions to improve Pasmo
and to patches that implements it. In the later case please take
care to write things in a portable way, without operating system
or compiler dependences.
</p>

<h3>Why Pasmo can not generate linkable code?</h3>

<p>
Pasmo has a simple code generator that uses absolute address of memory.
That will make difficult to adapt it to generate relocatable code for
use with linkers.
I don't have plans to do it for the moment, maybe someone want to
contribute?
</p>

<h3>Game Boy.</h3>

<p>
Some people suggested to add support for Game Boy programming. There
are two problems, the simplified way used to generate code in Pasmo,
and my inexistent knowledge of the Game Boy.
</p>

<h3>Thanks.</h3>

<p>
Thanks to all people that has made suggestions and notified or
corrected bugs. And to these that show me the beautiful things they
do with Pasmo.
</p>

<h2><a name="tricks">Tricks</a>.</h2>

<p>
You can use Pasmo to convert any binary file to .tap, just write a tiny
program called for example convert.asm:
</p>

<pre>
	ORG address_to_load_the_file
	INCBIN file.bin
</pre>

<p>
Assemble it with: pasmo --tap convert.asm file.tap, and you have it.
The same may be done for the other formats supported.
</p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a>.</h2>

<p>
If you accidentally try to use an inexistent Z80 instruction such
as 'ls b,(nn)' Pasmo can't detect the error because it interprets
the instruction as 'ld b,n', taken the expression with parenthesis
as the value of n. Forbid that will make more difficult to use
instructions such as 'ld b,(a1 + a2)/2', and in the way currently
used to parse expressions is not possible to distinguish between
this cases.<br>
A possible solution is to disambiguate the meaning of the parenthesis
by  using '[ ]' instead of '( )' to mean 'position pointed by', a
future version of Pasmo may include a option to do that. But that
does not solve the problem if you need or want to use the classic
syntax. I'm open to suggestions.
