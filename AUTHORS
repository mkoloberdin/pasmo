Adriano Camargo Rodrigues da Cunha wrote the initial implemntation of
the listing code, the .PHASE and .DEPHASE directives and other stuff,
but I rewritted it almost completely during transition to 0.6.0, so
blame me for all the bugs.

Some parts were rewritten according to bugs reports of the Debian
community.
